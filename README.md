## hey there👋

I'm a self-taught developer based in Germany, mainly working with Python and C#.
I enjoy building projects that are fun, practical, or simply interesting enough to explore.

I speak English, German, Danish, and Spanish, and I appreciate good conversations — preferably accompanied by a cold beer

Most of my projects are written in Python, and as a retired 28-year-old, I spend my spare time building
software that I find fun, useful, or just a bit silly.

Always open to collaborations, feedback, tips, or new project opportunities.
Feel free to reach out here on GitHub or on Twitter.
