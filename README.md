## hellos 👋

I'm a self-taught developer based in Germany.
Most of my projects are written in Python, and as a retired 28-year-old, I spend my spare time building
software that I find fun, useful, or just a bit silly.

I speak and understand English, German, Danish, and Spanish — and I’ll never say no to a cold beer🍺

I'm always open to projects, tips, collaborations, or just a friendly chat — feel free to reach out here on
GitHub or on Twitter.
