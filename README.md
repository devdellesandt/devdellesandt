## Hey Ther'👋

I'm a self-taught developer based in Germany, mainly working with Python and C#. I enjoy building projects
that are fun, practical, or simply interesting enough to explore.

I speak English, German, Danish, and Spanish, and I appreciate good conversations
preferably accompanied by a cold beer 🍺

Always open to collaborations, feedback, tips, or new project opportunities.
Feel free to reach out here on GitHub or on Twitter.
